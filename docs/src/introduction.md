# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the SLIMS REST API. This project provides a JSON:API compliant RESTful interface for interacting with a SLiMS (Senayan Library Management System) database.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and users of the API. It covers everything from setting up the application to using its various features and contributing to its development.

## What is SLiMS?

SLiMS (Senayan Library Management System) is an open-source library management system. It is used to manage library collections, member information, circulation, and other standard library operations. This API provides a modern, headless way to interact with the data stored in a SLiMS database.

## What is JSON:API?

This API adheres to the [JSON:API specification](https://jsonapi.org/). This is a standardized format for structuring JSON responses and requests. It helps to eliminate inconsistencies and allows for more efficient and predictable interactions with the API. Key features include conventions for naming, relationships, and linking, which you will see throughout this documentation. We will cover more details in the [JSON:API](api/json_api.md) section.

## Project Goals

*   Provide a stable, fast, and reliable REST API for SLiMS.
*   Adhere to modern API standards with a JSON:API-first approach.
*   Enable developers to build new applications and integrations on top of SLiMS.
*   Maintain a well-documented and easy-to-contribute open-source project.
